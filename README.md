# Autonomus-Fruit-Picking-Robot
WPI RBE 1001 Final Project. Worked with Michael Sacca to design a fully autonomus fruit picking robot in a simulated orchard. USed VEX V5 Hardware & VSCode.

Roles in project included:

•	Designed and tested 3 gripper prototypes, selecting the most reliable based on speed and handling precision
•	Developed Python scripts for real-time object detection and autonomous navigation using multi-sensor input
•	Led the design and implementation of the fruit depositing system, achieving 92% accuracy in bin deposits
